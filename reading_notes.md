## How to classify unlabeled data?
- ensemble learning: train some classifiers and label the data whenever almost all classifiers agree on that label
- use simple knn and label the data with high confidence
- train a classifier. Then pick some data and choose those with high confidence and add them to training set. iterate again. psuedo labeling.
- active learning

## How to find out model/data drift? How detect it? types of drifts. NannyML package to detect drifts.

Covariate shift: shift in input data (independent variables).
Prior probability shift: shift in target variables.
Concept drift: change the relation between input and target.
