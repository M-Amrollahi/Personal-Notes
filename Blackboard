Advantages of installing a package from source:
-You can install the latest version and can always stay updated, whether it be a security patch or a new feature.
-Allows you to trim down the features while installing so as to suit your needs.
-Similarly you can add some features which may not be provided in the binary.
-Install it in a location you wish.
-In case of some software you may provide your hardware specific info for a suitable installation.
In short installing from source gives you heavy customization option at the same time it takes a lot of effort, 
while installation from binary is easier but you may not be able to customize as you wish.
